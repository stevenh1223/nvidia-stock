# Web Development Project - _Nvidia Stock_

Submitted by: **Steven Hsiao**

This web app: **Nvidia's stock price over the past 10 days from the marketstack API**

## Features

The following features are implemented:

- The site displays a list of data fetched using an API call, using the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax
- The app dashboard includes three summary statistics about the data, such as: the total number of items in the dataset, the mean, and ranges of the data
- A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data
- Multiple different filters allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories
- Each detail view of an item has a direct, unique link to that itemâ€™s detail view page
